# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis

This repository contains scripts and documentation for performing differential expression analysis on single-cell RNA-Seq data. The analysis is designed to identify genes that are differentially expressed between different conditions or cell types.


## Requirements
- R: Ensure you have R installed on your machine. The analysis heavily relies on R and Bioconductor packages.

- RStudio (optional): While not mandatory, RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for running R scripts and visualizing results.

- Bioconductor packages: Install necessary Bioconductor packages, such as DESeq2. You can install them using the following commands:
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DESeq2")

- Seurat (optional): If you prefer using Seurat for single-cell analysis, make sure to install it. Seurat provides a comprehensive toolkit for single-cell data exploration and analysis
install.packages("Seurat")


## Usage

1. Data Preparation: Organize your single-cell RNA-Seq count matrix and metadata file. Ensure that the data is formatted correctly for downstream analysis.

2. Load Libraries and Data: Open the R script, load the required libraries, and read in your single-cell RNA-Seq data.

3. Preprocess Data: Perform data preprocessing steps, such as quality control, filtering, and normalization. Use functions from the selected package (e.g., Seurat, DESeq2) for these tasks.

4. Differential Expression Analysis: Conduct differential expression analysis between different conditions or cell types. Utilize appropriate statistical tests and adjust for multiple testing.

5. Visualization: Generate visualizations to explore the results of the analysis. This may include heatmaps, volcano plots, and other plots to highlight differentially expressed genes.

6. Interpretation: Interpret the results and draw biological insights from the differentially expressed genes. Consider pathway enrichment analysis for a more comprehensive understanding (https://string-db.org/)
